# Phone-Book-Management-System
This C++ Phone Book System, built in my first semester at COMSATS University, showcases file handling and object-oriented programming. It manages contacts in a binary file with a simple menu to add, view, search, update, or delete records, reflecting my early skills in creating practical, user-friendly programs.
